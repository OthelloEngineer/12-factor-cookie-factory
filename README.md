# 12-factor-cookie-factory
A repository for a 12-factor app workshop with incremental steps through the 12-factor principles.

The repository follows a cookie factory that would like to scale their production while maintaining a decoupled and maintainable code base for all of their cookie production. 

They heard of magic tricks from Heroku known as the "12-factor app" principles that they would like to implement super-boost their new transition.

This repository is takes on the journey where the developer is able to see snapshots of the cookie factory's implementation journey where the milestones of a 12-factor migration would be implemented. 



The different snapshots are shown as directories:
1. Fantastic cookie recipes, and where to find them. 
2. One cookie recipe to rule them all!
3. Separating chocolate chips from cookie logic 
4. R&D cookie room to the cookie factory
5. The two cookie problem
6. Yuck, sticky dough!
7. The s'mores'n'gingerbread menace
8. Beating around the batter
9. Disposing the raisin cookie by-product
10. Cream-lining the sabayon-cookie
11. Customer cookie-faction pipeline
12. CCC: Cookie Cleaning Chaos!.
